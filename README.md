# Presonal-Medic
Personal Medic which is your own A.I health helper/checker, which can analyse and gives you an in depth knowladge of any type of bacteria or illness. With the integrated A.I you can chat with it regarding various health releated topics and get more awareness about various health risks

If you are feeling any type of weekness or illness, and want immediate cure, you can simply tell to A.I about how you are feeling and it will analyse it and gives you expected reasons about this and can tell you it's cure or what action you have to take from now.
It will also stores your medical history (if you want) and can analyse your current health status with the previous one's and give you link or relation (if any), so you can take proper action.



First create virtual enivronment (.env) in your Python environment then add all the files

In these, I added disease_symptoms.csv file, which contains different types of disease and their symptoms and how to treat it. Using this csv file we are estimating everything using ML model.
